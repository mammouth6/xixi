            The public house restaurant, located in the city center, invites you
            to feel like a real aristocrat and taste delicious dishes of Russian,
            European and Caucasian cuisines. In addition to delicious and
            affordable meals and drinks on Fridays and Saturdays, you will find
            pleasant musical accompaniment.
          </p>
          <p class="norm-text">
            An atmosphere of ease conducive to relaxation is created by a
            spectacular, but at the same time unobtrusive and eye-pleasing
            interior, designed in a classic style: soft sofas and armchairs,
            massive tables. The decor is dominated by soothing shades of beige and
            brown. You can sit in the main hall or on a low podium. There are also
            three original halls for you, each of which is decorated in a special
            color, with a capacity of up to 150 people.
          </p>
          <p class="norm-text">
            The reason to come here can be very different: be it a business
            meeting, a romantic date, a corporate event or a family holiday - the
            unique atmosphere of nobility, hospitality and kindness will make a
            visit to the "public house" unforgettable. Here everyone is provided
            with a warm, almost homely welcome.
